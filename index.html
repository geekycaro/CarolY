    <p>Modern look eyeglasses for anyone who is always looking out for fashion and yet not over spend. Story behind this line is pretty simple.
        I have always aspired to be a business owner. Being able to create and produce a final product and deliver a great 
        service have been a personal goal. The challenges that come with being proactive, understanding my market, and 
        persevere through the obstacles have definitely brought to life a vision of my own. See, vision doesn't have to be 
        an abstract thought, but it is applied to one's sight. "Querer es poder." One of the quotes my mom has always 
        reminded me of. It means that if you want something so bad, you can do it!
